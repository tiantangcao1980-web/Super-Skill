# Tencent Ecosystem — Component Libraries

> Last audit: 2026-05. Health: `active` = last commit < 6 months, `maintenance` = 6-24 months, `deprecated` = 2+ years or archived.

## Summary

Tencent's component library strategy converges on **TDesign** as the cross-platform design system, covering 7 runtimes (Vue 2/3, React, Mobile Vue/React, WeChat MiniProgram, Flutter) with unified design tokens. WeUI, the older CSS-only system, has been demoted from "MiniProgram default" to "lightweight WeChat H5 styling" — still maintained but no longer the recommended primary choice.

## When to choose

### Choose TDesign when
- You need **unified design language across 3+ platforms** (e.g. web dashboard + MiniProgram + mobile H5)
- You're building a Tencent-ecosystem product or integrating Tencent Cloud services
- You want **modern clean aesthetics** (vs Ant's denser corporate look)
- You need **both Vue and React** variants with identical visual parity

### Do NOT choose when
- Your team is already deep in Ant Design (switching cost > design system benefit)
- You need overseas community resources (English-first docs are thinner than Ant's)

### WeUI guidance
- Use only for **legacy WeChat H5 webviews** where you want native-WeChat look with minimal JS
- Don't use as a primary MiniProgram component library → use `tdesign-miniprogram` or `vant-weapp` instead
