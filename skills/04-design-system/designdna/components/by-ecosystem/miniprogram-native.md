# MiniProgram — Native Component Libraries (WeChat)

> Last audit: 2026-05. This file covers **native WeChat MiniProgram component libraries** (no Taro/UniApp compilation layer).

## TL;DR

- **Two libraries are safe first choices in 2026: Vant Weapp and TDesign MiniProgram**.
- Choose `tdesign-miniprogram` when Tencent ecosystem alignment, cross-platform TDesign parity, or the official retail starter matters.
- Every other popular MiniProgram UI library is either deprecated or barely maintained.

## Roster

| Library | Stars | Last commit | Latest ver | Health | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| [tdesign-miniprogram (Tencent)](https://github.com/Tencent/tdesign-miniprogram) | 1.6k | 2026-05 | 1.14.0 | **active** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ First choice (see tencent.md) |
| [Wux Weapp](https://github.com/wux-weapp/wux-weapp) | 5.1k | 2024-04 | v3.11.3 | **maintenance** | ⭐⭐⭐ Alternate if Vant lacks a needed component |

## Selection heuristic

```
Project constraint                              → Pick
------------------------------------------------+------------------------
WeChat MiniProgram only, need rich components   → Vant Weapp
WeChat MiniProgram only, Tencent-integrated     → tdesign-miniprogram
Multi-vendor MiniProgram (WeChat + Alipay + …)  → Taro + NutUI   [see jd.md]
UniApp codebase                                 → nutui-uniapp / uni-ui
Legacy project still on iView Weapp             → Plan migration to Vant Weapp
```

## Native vs cross-platform trade-off

| Dimension | Native (Vant / TDesign / Wux) | Cross-platform (Taro + NutUI / UniApp) |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime performance | ✅ Direct `Component()`, zero overhead | ⚠️ Compilation shim cost |
| Multi-vendor support | ❌ WeChat only | ✅ 7+ MiniProgram vendors + H5 + RN |
| Native API access | ✅ Seamless | ⚠️ Requires bridge/adapter |
| Ecosystem maturity | ✅ Battle-tested docs | ✅ Depends on Taro/UniApp maturity |
| Team familiarity | Native WXML/WXSS | React/Vue mental model |

## Deprecated details

- Status: Company pivoted out of frontend tooling; 320+ open issues unresponded
- Docs site (`weapp.iviewui.com`) exists but legacy-only
- **Do not use for new projects.**

### Wuss Weapp
- 500 commits, last 2020-05. Maintainer moved on.
- Had an active QQ support group, code is effectively abandoned.

### TouchWX
- Only 30 commits, experimental from the start.

### Wux Weapp (borderline)
