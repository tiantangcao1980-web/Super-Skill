# Alibaba Ecosystem — Component Libraries

> Last audit: 2026-05. Health: `active` / `maintenance` / `deprecated`.

## Summary

Alibaba's frontend ecosystem centers on **Ant Design** as the de-facto Chinese B2B admin/dashboard standard (97k+ stars). The full matrix covers core components, scenario components (Pro, X for AI, Charts/AntV), application framework (Umi), form engine (Formily), docs generator (Dumi), and hooks utilities (ahooks). DingTalk Standard is a **Figma spec + design tokens only** — no standalone component library — and in practice enterprise integrators wrap `antd` to meet DingTalk visual guidelines.

## Vue-side alternatives (for perspective)

When you're on Vue, pick based on visual and team context:

| Library | Stars | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| Ant Design Vue | 20k | B2B admin, visual parity with React antd |
| Element Plus | 26k | Chinese B2B admin, localized docs |
| Naive UI | 17k | TS-first, modern, flexible theming (endorsed by Evan You) |
| Vuetify | 40k | Material Design flavor |
| Quasar | 26k | Cross-platform (SPA/SSR/PWA/App/MiniProgram) |
| Arco Design Vue | 4k | ByteDance's Arco visual language |

## Ant vs TDesign — decision cheat sheet

| Criterion | Ant Design | TDesign |
|---|---|---|
| Community reach | Huge (97k+) | Medium (7 repos × 1-3k) |
| Ecosystem depth | Pro / X / Charts / Umi / Formily | Flutter + MiniProgram + Mobile React/Vue — multi-runtime parity |
| Visual feel | Dense, established B2B | Cleaner, more modern, more whitespace |
| Best for | Existing antd teams, overseas community | Tencent-integrated products, multi-platform consistency |

## Ant Design v6 notes

- Requires React >= 18.
- Uses CSS variables by default and no longer supports IE.
- `@ant-design/icons` must be upgraded to v6 when used with `antd@6`.
- Prefer token/component-token APIs and semantic `classNames` / `styles` slots over internal DOM selectors.
- Use `@ant-design/cli` for exact prop, token, semantic slot, and migration checks across v4/v5/v6 snapshots.

## Dial fit

| Dial | Ant Design positioning |
|---|---|
| Formality | 8-9 (established B2B) |
| Motion | 3-4 (understated) |
| Density | 6-7 (data-heavy) |
| Warmth | 4-5 (neutral-cool) |
| Contrast | 6-7 (professional legibility) |
